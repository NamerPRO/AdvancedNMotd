# Syntax: ruleName: 'description of rule using diamond brackets'
# Usage: 'ruleName<possible diamond brackets code>: your custom text'

Rules:

  # Creating a rule that centers text.
  # (this file can contain many rules)

  # The '...' is filled with a description of the formatting rule using diamond brackets.
  # Therefore, the string must begin and end with '<' and '>' respectively.
  # Once every user specified bracket for rule 'center' is executed the one that represents rule 'center' is.
  # This achieves same behaviour as if 'center' format rule was a real (programmed) one.
  center: '<parse "format: c{%this%}"; return "%this%";>'
