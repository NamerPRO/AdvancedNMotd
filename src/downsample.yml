Downsample:

    Gradient:
        # If a player with a legacy client (< 1.16)
        # views your server's motd, change every
        # gradient #F0F0F0->#123456 to &7
        # (if a replacement is not directly
        # written, plugin will automatically downgrade
        # gradient by its first color).
        "#F0F0F0->#123456": "&7"

    Colors:
        # If a player with a legacy client (< 1.16)
        # views your server's motd, change every #CF3476
        # color in it to &5 (if a replacement is not directly
        # written, plugin will automatically find the closest
        # color in its opinion).
        "#CF3476": "&5"
